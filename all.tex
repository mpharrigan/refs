\subsection{Roads towards fault-tolerant universal quantum computation}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-fault-tolerant-computation}
\cite{2017-fault-tolerant-computation}.


Superconducting qubits [2013-superconducting-qubit-outlook=3].

Gottesman-Knill theorem says you need T in addition to S, H, and CNOT or
you get no quantum [1997-gottesman-thesis=9] (ref. 10).

Trivial codes can't have transversal implementations of all gates for
universal compuation (ref. 11) (ref. 12).

Surface code first as a topological memory [2002-surface-code=13]. Logical
qubit can be two holes in a code sheet (ref. 17) or two pairs of latice
defects or twists (ref. 18) (ref. 19).




\subsection{Quantum software}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-insight}
\cite{2017-insight}.


Nature ran a featurette where everyone mused about quantum computing and
how to make it useful. Includes [2017-fault-tolerant-computation],
[2017-quantum-programming-language],




\subsection{Programming languages and compiler design for realistic quantum hardware}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-quantum-programming-language}
\cite{2017-quantum-programming-language}.


Quantum/classical co-processor model described by [2015-quipper=19].




\subsection{First quantum computers need smart software}

\cite{2017-rigetti-quantum-software}.


A comment that argues for good quantum software.




\subsection{Charge- and Flux-Insensitive Tunable Superconducting Qubit}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-tunable}
\cite{2017-tunable}.


Improve fluxonimum (ref. 10) (ref. 11) (ref. 12) (ref. 13) (ref. 14) (ref.
15) with "sweet spots". I think this is just simulations of how it would
behave w.r.t noise though.

Static qubit-qubit couplings with 2q-gates in hundreds of nanoseconds,
100us coherence, and fidelity of 99.1% (ref. 1) (ref. 2) (ref. 3).

Frequency tinable qubits: 20us coherence, 50ns 2q-gates and 99.44% fidelity
(ref. 4) (ref. 5). Fluctuations from flux noise ruin coherence (ref. 6)
(ref. 7) (ref. 8). Also not anharmonic enough means leaks to higher levels
(ref. 9).




\subsection{Demonstration of Universal Parametric Entangling Gates on a Multi-Qubit
  Lattice}

\subsection{tICA-Metadynamics: Accelerating Metadynamics by Using Kinetically Selected Collective Variables}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-tica-metadynamics}
\cite{2017-tica-metadynamics}.


\subsection{Variational Koopman models: Slow collective variables and molecular kinetics from short off-equilibrium simulations}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-noe-reversible-tica}
\cite{2016-noe-reversible-tica}.


Provides a better way of "symetrizing" tICA correlation matrix. In tICA,
you assume that the dynamics are reversible. When we're learning from
finite data, this reversibility isn't respected. Historically, you take
your correlation matrix, add its transpose, and divide by two. This is an
especially poor approximation if you have many short trajectories. This
paper is analogous to the MLE method for symetrizing MSM counts matrices.




\subsection{Learning Important Features Through Propagating Activation Differences}

\cite{2017-herg-structure}.


\subsection{Set-free Markov state model building}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-set-free-msm}
\cite{2017-set-free-msm}.


Collection of m "base points" they make a gaussian RBF of distances to base
points. They normalize it to unity. This is the softmax function, but they
don't call it that.

They add base points adaptively and use PCCA+ to lump.

Note that they have stopped calling this "meshless" or "mesh-free",
probably because the regular MSM is also meshless. Now the abstract says
"This kind of meshless discretization..."




\subsection{Structures of closed and open states of a voltage-gated sodium channel}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-navab}
\cite{2017-navab}.


Open PD/VSD (5vb8) and closed PD/VSD/CTD (5vb2)

closed. This is NavMs and that is NavAb.




\subsection{Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution}

\cite{2017-euk-navpas}.

elecrophysiology can be performed. Was originally called PaFPC1, they
renamed it NaVPaS




\subsection{Simulating the Activation of Voltage Sensing Domain for a Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Using Polarizable Force Field}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2017-vsd-only-pmf}
\cite{2017-vsd-only-pmf}.


They simulated only one domain. They took the NavAb vsd and connected it
via molecular dynamics to a homology model to a [sea
squirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciona_intestinalis) vsd. They used a
polarizable force-field, which is more expensive than normal (fixed charge)
forcefields but that might be important for something so intertwined with
moving electrical charges!




\subsection{Identification of simple reaction coordinates from complex dynamics}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-sparsetica}
\cite{2016-sparsetica}.


The authors argue for a definition of the reaction coordinate as the
projection on the dominant eigenfunciton of the propogator. Notably, they
say that path-based coordinates are no good, because progress is only
defined along the path. They argue that the coordinate shouldn't depend on
start and end points. They say the projection should be maximally
predictive. This means finding the slowest modes. They note
[2006-nadler-diffusion-maps=61] and [2011-rohrdanz-diffusion-maps=62] have
used this definition.

They go on to show tICA finds this reaction coordinate. To make tICA more
interpretable, they develop an algorithm for introducing a sparsity
pattern. It's a pseudo-l0 regularization (made smooth so the optimization
works).

They also use a unique dihedral featurization: instead of taking the sine
and cosine to get around periodicity concerns; they project the values on a
bunch of evenly spaced von-mises (periodic gaussians) distributions around
the unit circle. Each dihedral is expanded into several numbers. It's like
a smooth histogramming. This probably won't work as the number of dihedrals
gets large (too many features).




\subsection{MSMBuilder: Statistical Models for Biomolecular Dynamics}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-msmbuilder3}
\cite{2016-msmbuilder3}.


\subsection{Optimized parameter selection reveals trends in Markov state models for protein folding}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-husic-msms}
\cite{2016-husic-msms}.


The authors perform GMRQ cross validation on the twelve
[2011-larsen-folding] folding trajectories to give guidelines for MSM
construction.

They present a flowchart for MSM construction that shows the three paths
towards clustering: from an rmsd distance metric, from features, or from
tICA learned on features.

They introduce GMRQ cross validation in the tradition of
[2015-mcgibbon-gmrq=44].

They present results but stress that you have to do your own cross
validataion to be sure. Some conclusions include: 1. tICA and PCA are
better than direct clustering of features 2. when using tica, you can use
kcenters, kmeans, or minibatch kmeans to the same effect

On one protein (2p6j) they look at all different features and show that
they vary a lot. It's unfortunate that this was only done on one protein.




\subsection{Commute Maps: Separating Slowly Mixing Molecular Configurations for Kinetic Modeling}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-commute-maps}
\cite{2016-commute-maps}.


Scale tIC coordinates by a function of the timescale. See also
[2015-kinetic-mapping].




\subsection{Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-neural-computers}
\cite{2016-neural-computers}.


Augment deep networks with an external memory (RAM) matrix.

Bart says: "TL;DR: This work follows a line of research that teaches
deep-nets to learn algorithmic tasks (addition, sorting, multiplication,
key-value look-up). This paper goes a bit further and teaches their network
to do shortest-path finding in graphs and demonstrates on maps of the
London underground. Cool demo with nice results, but the hype-machine has
blown it out of proportion (check out the FT article for a breathless take
claiming thinking computers are one step closer...)"




\subsection{Automatic chemical design using a data-driven continuous representation
  of molecules}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-aspuru-mol-feat}
\cite{2016-aspuru-mol-feat}.


The authors train an auto-encoder to provide a vector representation for
small molecules. Small molecules are graphs with varying sizes, so they're
hard to feed into neural nets (which require fixed-length bitvectors). By
fusing together an encoder and decoder (and making the "middle"
representation sufficiently small), they learn a vector representation.

The authors lean heavily on [arxiv:1511.06349=25] to autoencode SMILES
strings.

They use a variational autoencoder (noisy) to avoid "dead zones" in latent
space.

They optomize OLED properties as an example.




\subsection{Modelling proteinsâ hidden conformations to predict antibiotic resistance}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2016-msm-cryptic-binding}
\cite{2016-msm-cryptic-binding}.


Labmate summarizes:

They generated ensembles using MD, then docked to those ensembles, then
re-weighted the docking scores based on the MSM. This gave a huge
improvement in the predictive power of docking to predict affinity/potency.
It turned an inverse relationship (when docking using xtal structures) into
a highly correlated trend.

They confirmed their hypothesis about the protein flexibility by using a
mass spec. method.

They identified a loop movement important in the anti-antibacterial
activity of the enzyme that was different from one previously
proposed/suspected.

They proposed mutants that would stabilize their proposed loop, and tested
them experimentally.

The power of using the MSM to re-weight other analyses is also very
encouraging to see yet again. Also note that they did all this with what
looks like a pretty low amount of aggregate sampling (few microseconds per
mutant).




\subsection{A functional architecture for scalable quantum computing}

Correlated material simulations (ref. 11).

Approximate optimization (ref. 12).

For the problems of catalysts (ref. 13) and high temperature
superconductivity (ref. 9) show promise.

Cryo operation and superconducting materials means no sissipation
preserving quantum coherance.

Transmon qubits have large coherence time (ref. 14). Fluxonium qubits have
wide frequency tunability and strong nonlinearity (ref. 15). This means
fluxonium are better for two-qubit gates.

Quantum limited amplifiers (ref. 16) (ref. 17) (ref. 18): Josephson
parametric amplifier, Josephson bifurcation amplifier, and Josephson
parametric converter. Non-linear resonators.

Can do rotations Rx and Ry on any qubit. Can do SWAP between any transmon
and fluxonium. Can do CPhase between any fluxonium and half the transmons.
All gates can be made with these primitives (ref. 19).

Introduce "TQF" estimate of width * depth of quantum circuit you can run.
(ref. 1) runs electronic structure for very small molecules.

Transmon can be "data" for surface code error correction (ref. 24) (ref.
25) and fluxonium as ancillas for parity measurement.

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2015-amino-acid-basis}
\cite{2015-amino-acid-basis}.


Authors simulate individual (capped) amino acids for 1us / each and
construct (mini-)MSMs on each one. They use the outerproduct of these
mini-MSMs to serve as a basis set for peptides. MiniMSMs are on a grid in
phi-psi angles. Since each miniMSM has approx 3 modes, the full basis would
be 3^(N), which is way too big! They call the second and third modes
"excited states" and use a basis set that contains a singly-exited residue.

\subsection{Modeling Molecular Kinetics with tICA and the Kernel Trick}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2015-schwantes-ktica}
\cite{2015-schwantes-ktica}.


They introduce kernel tICA as an extension to tICA. This is useful to get
non-linear solutions to the tICA equation. They claim you can estimate
eigenprocesses without building an MSM.

They briefly introduce the transfer operator. They introduce the
variational principle of conformation dynamics per [2011-prinz=25]. They
introduce tICA as maximizing the autocorrelation. They say that solutions
to tICA are the same as solutions to the variational problem per
[2013-noe-tica=28]. Linearity makes them crude solutions.

They explain that a natural approach to introduce non-linearity is to
expand the original representation into a higher dimensional space and do
tICA there. They say this is impractical. The expanded space probably has
to be huge. You can perform analysis in the big representation without
explicitly representing it by using the "kernel trick". They reproduce an
example of the kernel trick from [1998-scholkopf-kernel-pca=39].

They re-write the tICA problem only in terms of inner products so you can
apply the kernel trick. They introduce normalization. They choose a
gaussian kernel. They simulate a four-well potential, muller potential,
alanine dipeptide, and fip35ww. They need to do MLE cross validation over
parameters (kernel width and regularization strength).

This uses so much RAM! Huge matrices to solve (that scale with the amount
of data!!)

\subsection{Ion permeation in K+ channels occurs by direct Coulomb knock-on}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2014-kopfer-hard-knock}
\cite{2014-kopfer-hard-knock}.


Introduces a new way of simulating a membrane potential: They stack two
membranes on top of one another, creating an "inside" between the two. This
doesn't hurt simulation throughput, because you get twice as much protein
motion data in the same amount of simulation time (ignore extra factor of
log n in system size). This seems to be a refinement on their earlier work
in [2011-kutzner-double-membrane=25].

They hide the startling fact that every time an ion moves through the
channel, they have to instantaneously move it back inside. Benoit has
argued that this instantaneous jump, which can be a 100 mV difference is
rediculous.

The main point of this paper is that ions translocate through the four
sites of potassium channel without any waters between them. This "hard
knock" mechanism is in contrast to a "soft knock" mechanism where the
ion-ion interactions are softened by interviening waters.

They re-refine the xray data to show it is consistent with the hard-knock

This is before [2015-mcgibbon-gmrq] GRMQ cross-validation. They explicitly
find the volume of voronoi cells (in low number of tIC space) to find a
likelihood. They use AIC/BIC to find the number of states to use. Finding
volumes is tough and you still can't compare across protocols (so you can
basically only scan number of states or clustering method), but! this was
the first paper to seriously suggest using a smaller number of states to
avoid overfitting.

\subsection{Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional
  non-convex optimization}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2014-ganguli-saddle-points}
\cite{2014-ganguli-saddle-points}.


Labmate summarizes:

This one is a really cool paper.  One of those "we've all been doing it
wrong" papers that could have a big impact.  Their main conclusions are

1. When optimizing functions in high dimensional spaces, saddle points are
a much bigger problem than local minima.  There are far more of them, and
the few local minima that do exist mostly have values only slightly worse
than the global minimum.

2. Standard optimization methods deal really badly with saddle points (and
hence work really badly in high dimensional spaces).  First order methods
like gradient descent start taking tiny steps, so they take a really long
time to escape.  Quasi-Newton methods are even worse.  They just converge
to the saddle point and never escape.

3. They describe a new approach that doesn't have these problems and goes
right through saddle points without slowing down.

They do all this in the context of neural networks, but it likely applies
just as well to other high dimensional optimization problems.  Proteins,
for example.  When you use an algorithm like L-BFGS for energy
minimization, it's probably converging to a saddle point, not a local
minimum.  It could be really interesting to try their method.  Could we
fold a protein to the native state just by a straightforward energy
minimization?

Force field optimization is another case whether this approach could be
really useful.

They also show that at a saddle point, there's a strong monotonic
relationship between the error and the fraction of negative eigenvalues of
the Hessian.  Potentially that could be used as a way to measure how far
you are from the global minimum.  For example, when optimizing force field
parameters, it would tell you whether your parameters are close to optimal,
or whether there's still a lot of room to improve them further.

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2014-nuske-variational}

This paper is largely redundant with [2013-noe-variational=65]. They cite
it as such: "Following the recently introduced variational principle for
metastable stochastic processes,(65) we propose a variational approach to
molecular kinetics."

They perform their variational approach on 2- and 10-alanine in addition to
1D potentials.

This comes after tICA and cites [2013-schwantes-tica=57] and
[2013-noe-tica=58] in the intro, but does nothing further with it. In
particular, they don't note that tICA is just another choice of basis set.

\subsection{A Variational Approach to Modeling Slow Processes in Stochastic Dynamical Systems}

This paper can be cited with id \texttt{2013-noe-variational}
\cite{2013-noe-variational}.


I think the point of this versus [2014-nuske-variational] is to be "protein
agnostic". They allude to proteins, but say this is more general. Their
example is a double-well potential.

They introduce the propogator formalism and stipulate that dynamics can be
seperated into "fast" and "slow" components. In contrast to a quantum
mechanics Hamiltonian, we don't know the propogator here. You have to infer
it from data.

They claim the error bound derived in [2010-msm-error=34] is not
constructive, whereas this method *is* constructive.

Math section heavily cites [2010-msm-error=34].

They adapt the Rayleigh variational principle from quantum mechanics, and
cite [1989-szabo-ostlund-qm=43]. They show that the autocorrelation of the
true first dynamical eigenfunction is its eigenvalue, and an estimate of
the first dynamical eigenfunction necessarily has a smaller eigenvalue.
This sets the variational bound. In terms of names that don't seem to be
used now that we're in the future: the Ritz method is for when you have no
overlap integrals (e.g. MSMs) and the Roothan-Hall method is for when you
do (tICA).

They put it to the test on a double well potential. They use indicator
basis functions to make an MSM; hermite basis functions so they still have
no overlap integrals, but smooth functions; and gaussian basis functions
(with overlap integrals). This must have come before tICA because there is
no mention made of it, even though it would fit in nicely.

Taken from [Nature's protein folding
focus](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/focus/proteinfolding/classics/early.html)

Among the most widely cited-yet least read-papers in the field, partly
owing to the difficulties in getting hold of them, Cyrus Levinthal used a
simple model to show that a typical polypeptide chain cannot fold through
an unbiased search of all conformational space on a reasonable timescale.
This is commonly referred to as the "Levinthal's paradox", and led to the
concept that proteins fold along discrete pathways. The first paper
presents this idea and is usually cited, but the model is actually
presented in the second one. Although the model was later shown to be
overly simplistic, the work had a crucial role in directing the search and
characterization of intermediate states.

    This one computes the optimal rotation in addition to (specifically: after) just
    computing the minimal RMSD value. It uses [=14] for finding the optimal RMSD (ie
    leading eigenvalue of key matrix).

    Instead of doing matrix diagonalization or inversion, use netwon-raphson root-finding
    on a characteristic polynomial.

    Mainly builds off of [1987-horn-rmsd=5].

    Similar to [2005-theobald-rmsd], builds off of [1987-horn-rmsd=5]. Proves identity
    with normal 3x3 methods.

    Derives the derivative of RMSD wrt coordinates, although "it is well known [=13]"

    [2005-theobald-rmsd] says this suffers from rotoinversions because it uses
    3x3 rotations instead of 4x4 quaternions.

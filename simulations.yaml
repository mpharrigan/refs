    Simulation of fip35 ww domain: 2x 100 us. Note this was at 400K so unfolding could be observed.

    Simulation of bpti: 1ms. Note this was done with tip4p for reasons.

    The authors simulated folding trajectories for 12 small proteins. The simulations were
    between 100 us and 1 ms. This paper was a considerable advance for the field, and more
    or less closed the book on molecular dynamics for folding.

    They find an intermediate in [2011-larsen-folding] NuG2 trajectories that is a register
    shift that was missed before tICA+MSM.

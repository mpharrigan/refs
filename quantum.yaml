    Quantum simulation algorithsm [=1] [=2] [=3].

    Quantum machine learning [=4]

    Quantum error correction benchmarks [=5] [=6] [=7].

    Variational quantum eigensolvers [=8] [=9] [=10].

    Correlated material simulations [=11].

    Approximate optimization [=12].

    For the problems of catalysts [=13] and high temperature superconductivity [=9] show promise.

    Cryo operation and superconducting materials means no sissipation preserving quantum
    coherance.

    Transmon qubits have large coherence time [=14].
    Fluxonium qubits have wide frequency tunability and strong nonlinearity [=15].
    This means fluxonium are better for two-qubit gates.

    Quantum limited amplifiers [=16] [=17] [=18]: Josephson parametric amplifier,
    Josephson bifurcation amplifier, and Josephson parametric converter.
    Non-linear resonators.

    Can do rotations Rx and Ry on any qubit. Can do SWAP between any transmon and fluxonium.
    Can do CPhase between any fluxonium and half the transmons. All gates can be made
    with these primitives [=19].

    Introduce "TQF" estimate of width * depth of quantum circuit you can
    run. [=1] runs electronic structure for very small molecules.

    Transmon can be "data" for surface code error correction [=24] [=25]
    and fluxonium as ancillas for parity measurement.

    Improve fluxonimum [=10] [=11] [=12] [=13] [=14] [=15] with
    "sweet spots". I think this is just simulations of how it would
    behave w.r.t noise though.

    Static qubit-qubit couplings with 2q-gates in hundreds of
    nanoseconds, 100us coherence, and fidelity of 99.1% [=1] [=2] [=3].

    Frequency tinable qubits: 20us coherence, 50ns 2q-gates and
    99.44% fidelity [=4] [=5]. Fluctuations from flux noise ruin
    coherence [=6] [=7] [=8]. Also not anharmonic enough means
    leaks to higher levels [=9].

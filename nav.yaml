    They simulated only one domain. They took the NavAb vsd and connected it via molecular dynamics
    to a homology model to a [sea squirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciona_intestinalis) vsd.
    They used a polarizable force-field, which is more expensive than normal (fixed charge) forcefields
    but that might be important for something so intertwined with moving electrical charges!

    They simulated only one domain. They took the NavAb vsd and connected it via molecular dynamics
    to a homology model to a [sea squirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciona_intestinalis) vsd.
    They used a polarizable force-field, which is more expensive than normal (fixed charge) forcefields
    but that might be important for something so intertwined with moving electrical charges!

    First eukaryotic structure. CryoEM of cockroach NaV. Might not be a NaV.
    No elecrophysiology can be performed. Was originally called PaFPC1, they renamed
    it NaVPaS

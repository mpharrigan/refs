      They do 2D IR experiments whose spectra are consistent
      with a hard-knock mechanism. This refutes [2014-kopfer-hard-knock=17].

      Introduces a new way of simulating a membrane potential: They
      stack two membranes on top of one another, creating an "inside"
      between the two. This doesn't hurt simulation throughput, because
      you get twice as much protein motion data in the same amount of
      simulation time (ignore extra factor of log n in system size).
      This seems to be a refinement on their earlier work in
      [2011-kutzner-double-membrane=25].

      They hide the startling fact that every time an ion moves through
      the channel, they have to instantaneously move it back inside.
      Benoit has argued that this instantaneous jump, which can be
      a 100 mV difference is rediculous.

      The main point of this paper is that ions translocate through
      the four sites of potassium channel without any waters between
      them. This "hard knock" mechanism is in contrast to a "soft knock"
      mechanism where the ion-ion interactions are softened by interviening
      waters.

      They re-refine the xray data to show it is consistent with the
      hard-knock mechanism.
